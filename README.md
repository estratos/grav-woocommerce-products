## Grav WooCommerce Products Plugin
This **Woocommere Products** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). It will look for plaintext email addresses in your Grav pages and turn them into javascript encoded mailto links.

## Installation

Installing the Woocommerceplugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line). From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install woocommerce-products

This will install the plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/woocommerce-products`.

If you have the Admin plugin installed, you can also install it there under `plugins > add`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `antispam`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/estratos/grav-woocommerce-products/).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/woocommerce-products

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.
